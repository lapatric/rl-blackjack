# Let's start by creating the blackjack environment.
# Note: We are going to follow the rules from Sutton & Barto.
env = gym.make("Blackjack-v1", sab=True)

# Reset the environment to get the first state (observation)
# The state comprises of a 3-tuple (int, int, bool):
# - The players current sum
# - Value of the dealer's face-up card
# - Boolean whether the player holds a usable ace, i.e. an ace that count as 11 without busting
state, info = env.reset()
done = False

# Sample a random action from all valid actions
action = env.action_space.sample()

# Execute the action in our environment and receive data from the environment
# next_state: This is the observation that the agent will receive after taking the action.
# reward: This is the reward that the agent will receive after taking the action.
# terminated: This is a boolean variable that indicates whether or not the environment has terminated.
# truncated: This is a boolean variable that also indicates whether the episode ended by early truncation, i.e., time limit is reached.
# info: This is a dictionary that might contain additional information about the environment.
next_state, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(action)
# Once terminated or truncated is True, we should stop the current episode and begin a new one with env.reset(). 
# If you continue executing actions without resetting the environment, it still responds but the output wonâ€™t be useful 
# for training (it might even be harmful if the agent learns on invalid data).
